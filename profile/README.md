# Phidia

**Empowering airlines with intelligent, pilot-informed AI solutions.**  
Phidia builds data-driven decision-support systems that transform airline operations.
Through applied machine learning we aim to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enable smarter, faster decisionmaking.

## What We Do

Phidia bridges aviation expertise with modern software engineering to bring **AI into the operational core** of airlines.  
We design and deploy **modular, production-ready ML systems** that integrate seamlessly into existing infrastructures.

## How We Work

Our development model combines **aviation insight** with **modern cloud architecture**:

- **Off-the-shelf AI components**: Leveraging proven open-source and Azure ML models.  
- **External development capability**: Enabling rapid iteration and scalable delivery.  
- **Easy integration**: APIs and data pipelines built to plug into existing airline systems with minimal friction.

## Why Phidia

Phidia was founded by **airline pilots turned engineers**, giving us a unique advantage: we understand both **the cockpit and the code**.
Our goal: make operational AI **accessible, explainable, and effective**, not just another black box.
